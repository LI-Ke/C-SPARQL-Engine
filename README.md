# C-SPARQL-Engine

<p>Inspired by the paper <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1aca/dbf0c0616b4b9bd287ff8d9d164d96778589.pdf">C-SPARQL: A CONTINUOUS QUERY LANGUAGE FOR RDF DATA STREAMS</a> and examples of the C-SPARQL Engine shown in the <a href="http://streamreasoning.org/">Stream Reasoning</a> official website, I've written a complete but easy to understand example of the RDF Stream Processing with a C-SPARQL Engine.</p>
